# ChainReaction
A Godot game for desktop, android and the web

ChainReaction is a local multiplayer game in which each player puts their pieces in a board and when they reach the minimum (2 in a corner, 3 in an edge and 4 everywhere else)

You can download it [here](https://javier-morales-dev.itch.io/chainreaction)

It was built using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine (specifically version 4.3). To execute the code on your machine all you have to do is clone it and open it in Godot and you'd be upo and running
